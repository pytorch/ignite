# Reproducible trainings with Ignite

Inspired by [torchvision/references](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references), we provide several 
reproducible baselines for vision tasks:

* [ ] Classification
    * [ ] [ImageNet](classification/imagenet)

* [x] Segmentation
    * [x] [Pascal VOC2012](segmentation/pascal_voc2012)
    
* [ ] Detection
    * [ ] MS COCO
