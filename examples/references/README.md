# Reproducible trainings with Ignite

Inspired by [torchvision/references](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/references), we provide several 
reproducible baselines for vision tasks:

* [ ] Classification
    * [ ] [ImageNet](imagenet)

* [ ] Segmentation
    * [ ] Pascal VOC2012
    
* [ ] Detection
    * [ ] MS COCO

## Requirements:

We use `conda` and [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) to handle all python dependencies. 
Please, install these tools:

- [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow): `pip install mlflow`
- [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
