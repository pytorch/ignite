Concepts
========

Engine
------

The **essence** of the framework is the class :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`, an abstraction that loops a given number of times over
provided data, executes a processing function and returns a result:

.. code-block:: python

    while epoch < max_epochs:
        # run an epoch on data
        data_iter = iter(data)
        while True:
            try:
                batch = next(data_iter)
                output = process_function(batch)
                iter_counter += 1
            except StopIteration:
                data_iter = iter(data)

            if iter_counter == epoch_length:
                break

Thus, a model trainer is simply an engine that loops multiple times over the training dataset and updates model parameters.
Similarly, model evaluation can be done with an engine that runs a single time over the validation dataset and computes metrics.

For example, model trainer for a supervised task:

.. code-block:: python

    def train_step(trainer, batch):
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        x, y = prepare_batch(batch)
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item()

    trainer = Engine(train_step)
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=100)

The type of output of the training step (i.e. ``loss.item()`` in the above example) is not restricted. Training step
function can return everything user wants. Output is set to ``trainer.state.output`` and can be used further for any type of processing.

.. Note ::

    By default, epoch length is defined by ``len(data)``. However, user can also manually define the epoch length as a
    number of iterations to loop. In this way the input data can be an iterator.

    .. code-block:: python

        trainer.run(data, max_epochs=100, epoch_length=200)

    If data is a finite data iterator with unknown length (for user), argument ``epoch_length`` can be omitted and it
    will be automatically determined when data iterator is exhausted.


**Mostly any complexity training logic** can be coded as ``train_step`` method and a trainer constructed using this method.
Argument ``batch`` in ``train_step`` function is user-defined and can contain any data required for a single iteration.

.. code-block:: python

    model_1 = ...
    model_2 = ...
    # ...
    optimizer_1 = ...
    optimizer_2 = ...
    # ...
    criterion_1 = ...
    criterion_2 = ...
    # ...

    def train_step(trainer, batch):

        data_1 = batch["data_1"]
        data_2 = batch["data_2"]
        # ...

        model_1.train()
        optimizer_1.zero_grad()
        loss_1 = forward_pass(data_1, model_1, criterion_1)
        loss_1.backward()
        optimizer_1.step()
        # ...

        model_2.train()
        optimizer_2.zero_grad()
        loss_2 = forward_pass(data_2, model_2, criterion_2)
        loss_2.backward()
        optimizer_2.step()
        # ...

        # User can return any type of structure.
        return {
            "loss_1": loss_1,
            "loss_2": loss_2,
            # ...
        }

    trainer = Engine(train_step)
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=100)


For multi-models training examples like GAN's, please, see our :doc:`examples`.


Events and Handlers
-------------------

To improve the :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`'s flexibility, an event system is introduced that facilitates interaction on each step of
the run:

- *engine is started/completed*
- *epoch is started/completed*
- *batch iteration is started/completed*

Complete list of events can be found at :class:`~ignite.engine.events.Events`.

Thus, user can execute a custom code as an event handler. Handlers can be any function: e.g. lambda, simple function,
class method etc. The first argument can be optionally `engine`, but not necessary.

Let us consider in more detail what happens when :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.run` is called:

.. code-block:: python

    fire_event(Events.STARTED)
    while epoch < max_epochs:
        fire_event(Events.EPOCH_STARTED)
        # run once on data
        for batch in data:
            fire_event(Events.ITERATION_STARTED)

            output = process_function(batch)

            fire_event(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED)
        fire_event(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    fire_event(Events.COMPLETED)

At first *"engine is started"* event is fired and all its event handlers are executed (we will see in the next paragraph
how to add event handlers). Next, `while` loop is started and *"epoch is started"* event occurs, etc. Every time
an event is "fired", attached handlers are executed.

Attaching an event handler is simple using method :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.add_event_handler` or
:meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.on` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    trainer = Engine(update_model)

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.STARTED, lambda _: print("Start training"))
    # or
    @trainer.on(Events.STARTED)
    def on_training_started(engine):
        print("Another message of start training")
    # or even simpler, use only what you need !
    @trainer.on(Events.STARTED)
    def on_training_started():
        print("Another message of start training")

    # attach handler with args, kwargs
    mydata = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    def on_training_ended(data):
        print("Training is ended. mydata={}".format(data))

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, on_training_ended, mydata)

Event handlers can be detached via :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.remove_event_handler` or via the :class:`~ignite.engine.events.RemovableEventHandle`
reference returned by :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.add_event_handler`. This can be used to reuse a configured engine for multiple loops:

.. code-block:: python

    model = ...
    train_loader, validation_loader, test_loader = ...

    trainer = create_supervised_trainer(model, optimizer, loss)
    evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(model, metrics={"acc": Accuracy()})

    def log_metrics(engine, title):
        print("Epoch: {} - {} accuracy: {:.2f}"
               .format(trainer.state.epoch, title, engine.state.metrics["acc"]))

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def evaluate(trainer):
        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "train"):
            evaluator.run(train_loader)

        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "validation"):
            evaluator.run(validation_loader)

        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "test"):
            evaluator.run(test_loader)

    trainer.run(train_loader, max_epochs=100)


Event handlers can be also configured to be called with a user pattern: every n-th events, once or using a custom
event filtering function:

.. code-block:: python

    model = ...
    train_loader, validation_loader, test_loader = ...

    trainer = create_supervised_trainer(model, optimizer, loss)

    @trainer.on(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED(every=50))
    def log_training_loss_every_50_iterations():
        print("{} / {} : {} - loss: {:.2f}"
              .format(trainer.state.epoch, trainer.state.max_epochs, trainer.state.iteration, trainer.state.output))

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_STARTED(once=25))
    def do_something_once_on_25_epoch():
        # do something

    def custom_event_filter(engine, event):
        if event in [1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100]:
            return True
        return False

    @engine.on(Events.ITERATION_STARTED(event_filter=custom_event_filter))
    def call_on_special_event(engine):
         # do something on 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 iterations

    trainer.run(train_loader, max_epochs=100)


The user can also define custom events. Events defined by user should inherit from :class:`~ignite.engine.events.EventEnum`
and be registered with :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.register_events` in an `engine`.

.. code-block:: python

    from ignite.engine import EventEnum

    class CustomEvents(EventEnum):
        """
        Custom events defined by user
        """
        CUSTOM_STARTED = 'custom_started'
        CUSTOM_COMPLETED = 'custom_completed'

    engine.register_events(*CustomEvents)

These events could be used to attach any handler and are fired using :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.fire_event`.

.. code-block:: python

    @engine.on(CustomEvents.CUSTOM_STARTED)
    def call_on_custom_event(engine):
         # do something

    @engine.on(Events.STARTED)
    def fire_custom_events(engine):
         engine.fire_event(CustomEvents.CUSTOM_STARTED)

.. Note ::

   See the source code of :class:`~ignite.contrib.engines.create_supervised_tbptt_trainer` for an example of usage of
   custom events.

Handlers
````````

Library provides a set of built-in handlers to checkpoint the training pipeline, to save best models, to stop training
if no improvement, to use experiment tracking system, etc. They can be found in the following two modules:

- :doc:`handlers`
- :doc:`contrib/handlers`

Some classes can be simply added to :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine` as a callable function. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from ignite.handlers import TerminateOnNan

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED, TerminateOnNan())


Others provide an ``attach`` method to internally add several handlers to :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`:

.. code-block:: python

    from ignite.contrib.handlers.tensorboard_logger import *

    # Create a logger
    tb_logger = TensorboardLogger(log_dir="experiments/tb_logs")

    # Attach the logger to the trainer to log model's weights as a histogram after each epoch
    tb_logger.attach(
        trainer,
        event_name=Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED,
        log_handler=WeightsHistHandler(model)
    )


Timeline and events
```````````````````

Below the events and some typical handlers are displayed on a timeline for a training loop with evaluation after every
epoch:

.. image:: _static/img/concepts/timeline_and_events.png
   :target: _static/img/concepts/timeline_and_events.png

State
-----
A state is introduced in :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine` to store the output of the `process_function`, current epoch,
iteration and other helpful information. Each :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine` contains a :class:`~ignite.engine.events.State`,
which includes the following:

- **engine.state.seed**: Seed to set at each data "epoch".
- **engine.state.epoch**: Number of epochs the engine has completed. Initializated as 0 and the first epoch is 1.
- **engine.state.iteration**: Number of iterations the engine has completed. Initialized as 0 and the first iteration is 1.
- **engine.state.max_epochs**: Number of epochs to run for. Initializated as 1.
- **engine.state.output**: The output of the `process_function` defined for the :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`. See below.
- etc

Other attributes can be found in the docs of :class:`~ignite.engine.events.State`.

In the code below, `engine.state.output` will store the batch loss. This output is used to print the loss at 
every iteration.

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item()

    def on_iteration_completed(engine):
        iteration = engine.state.iteration
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output
        print("Epoch: {}, Iteration: {}, Loss: {}".format(epoch, iteration, loss))

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED, on_iteration_completed)

Since there is no restrictions on the output of `process_function`, Ignite provides `output_transform` argument for its
:class:`~ignite.metrics` and :class:`~ignite.handlers`. Argument `output_transform` is a function used to transform `engine.state.output` for intended use. Below we'll see different types of `engine.state.output` and how to transform them.

In the code below, `engine.state.output` will be a list of loss, y_pred, y for the processed batch. If we want to attach :class:`~ignite.metrics.Accuracy` to the engine, `output_transform` will be needed to get y_pred and y from
`engine.state.output`. Let's see how that is done:

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item(), y_pred, y

    trainer = Engine(update)

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def print_loss(engine):
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output[0]
        print ('Epoch {epoch}: train_loss = {loss}'.format(epoch=epoch, loss=loss))

    accuracy = Accuracy(output_transform=lambda x: [x[1], x[2]])
    accuracy.attach(trainer, 'acc')
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=10)

Similar to above, but this time the output of the `process_function` is a dictionary of loss, y_pred, y for the processed
batch, this is how the user can use `output_transform` to get y_pred and y from `engine.state.output`. See below:

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return {'loss': loss.item(),
                'y_pred': y_pred,
                'y': y}

    trainer = Engine(update)

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def print_loss(engine):
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output['loss']
        print ('Epoch {epoch}: train_loss = {loss}'.format(epoch=epoch, loss=loss))

    accuracy = Accuracy(output_transform=lambda x: [x['y_pred'], x['y']])
    accuracy.attach(trainer, 'acc')
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=10)

.. Note ::

   A good practice is to use :class:`~ignite.engine.events.State` also as a storage of user data created in update or handler functions.
   For example, we would like to save `new_attribute` in the `state`:

   .. code-block:: python

      def user_handler_function(engine):
          engine.state.new_attribute = 12345


Metrics
-------

Library provides a list of out-of-the-box metrics for various Machine Learning tasks. Two way of computing
metrics are supported : 1) online and 2) storing the entire output history.

Metrics can be attached to :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`:

.. code-block:: python

    from ignite.metrics import Accuracy

    accuracy = Accuracy()

    accuracy.attach(evaluator, "accuracy")

    state = evaluator.run(validation_data)

    print("Result:", state.metrics)
    # > {"accuracy": 0.12345}

or can be used as stand-alone objects:

.. code-block:: python

    from ignite.metrics import Accuracy

    accuracy = Accuracy()

    accuracy.reset()

    for y_pred, y in get_prediction_target():
        accuracy.update((y_pred, y))

    print("Result:", accuracy.compute())


Complete list of metrics and the API can be found in :doc:`metrics` module.
