Concepts
========

Engine
------

The **essence** of the framework is the class :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine`, an abstraction that loops a given number of times over
provided data, executes a processing function and returns a result:

.. code-block:: python

    while epoch < max_epochs:
        # run once on data
        for batch in data:
            output = process_function(batch)

Thus, a model trainer is simply an engine that loops multiple times over the training dataset and updates model parameters.
Similarly, model evaluation can be done with an engine that runs a single time over the validation dataset and computes metrics.
For example, model trainer for a supervised task:

.. code-block:: python

    def update_model(trainer, batch):
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        x, y = prepare_batch(batch)
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item()

    trainer = Engine(update_model)
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=100)

Events and Handlers
-------------------

To improve the :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine`'s flexibility, an event system is introduced that facilitates interaction on each step of
the run:

- *engine is started/completed*
- *epoch is started/completed*
- *batch iteration is started/completed*

Complete list of events can be found at :class:`~ignite.engine.Events`.

Thus, user can execute a custom code as an event handler. Let us consider in more detail what happens when
:meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.run` is called:

.. code-block:: python

    fire_event(Events.STARTED)
    while epoch < max_epochs:
        fire_event(Events.EPOCH_STARTED)
        # run once on data
        for batch in data:
            fire_event(Events.ITERATION_STARTED)

            output = process_function(batch)

            fire_event(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED)
        fire_event(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    fire_event(Events.COMPLETED)

At first *engine is started* event is fired and all this event handlers are executed (we will see in the next paragraph
how to add event handlers). Next, `while` loop is started and *epoch is started* event occurs, etc. Every time
an event is "fired", attached handlers are executed.

Attaching an event handler is simple using method :meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.add_event_handler` or
:meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.on` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    trainer = Engine(update_model)

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.STARTED, lambda engine: print("Start training"))
    # or
    @trainer.on(Events.STARTED)
    def on_training_started(engine):
        print("Another message of start training")

    # attach handler with args, kwargs
    mydata = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    def on_training_ended(engine, data):
        print("Training is ended. mydata={}".format(data))

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, on_training_ended, mydata)

Event handlers can be detached via :meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.remove_event_handler` or via the :class:`~ignite.engine.RemovableEventHandler`
reference returned by :meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.add_event_handler`. This can be used to reuse a configured engine for multiple loops:

.. code-block:: python

    model = ...
    train_loader, validation_loader, test_loader = ...

    trainer = create_supervised_trainer(model, optimizer, loss)
    evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(model, metrics={'acc': Accuracy()})

    def log_metrics(engine, title):
        print("Epoch: {} - {} accuracy: {:.2f}"
               .format(trainer.state.epoch, title, engine.state.metrics['acc']))

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def evaluate(trainer):
        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "train"):
            evaluator.run(train_loader)

        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "validation"):
            evaluator.run(validation_loader)

        with evaluator.add_event_handler(Events.COMPLETED, log_metrics, "test"):
            evaluator.run(test_loader)

    trainer.run(train_loader, max_epochs=100)

.. Note ::

   User can also register custom events with :meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.register_events`, attach handlers and fire custom events
   calling :meth:`~ignite.engine.Engine.fire_event` in any handler or `process_function`.

   See the source code of :class:`~ignite.contrib.engines.create_supervised_tbptt_trainer` for an example of usage of
   custom events.


Timeline and events
```````````````````

Below the events and some typical handlers are displayed on a timeline for a training loop with evaluation after every
epoch:

State
-----
A state is introduced in :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine` to store the output of the `process_function`, current epoch,
iteration and other helpful information. Each :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine` contains a :class:`~ignite.engine.State`, 
which includes the following:

- **engine.state.epoch**: Number of epochs the engine has completed. Initializated as 0. 
- **engine.state.max_epochs**: Number of epochs to run for. Initializated as 1. 
- **engine.state.iteration**: Number of iterations the engine has completed. Initialized as 0.
- **engine.state.output**: The output of the `process_function` defined for the :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine`. See below.

In the code below, `engine.state.output` will store the batch loss. This output is used to print the loss at 
every iteration.

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item()

    def on_iteration_completed(engine):
        iteration = engine.state.iteration
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output
        print("Epoch: {}, Iteration: {}, Loss: {}".format(epoch, iteration, loss))

    trainer.add_event_handler(Events.ITERATION_COMPLETED, on_iteration_completed)

Since there is no restrictions on the output of `process_function`, Ignite provides `output_transform` argument for its
:class:`~ignite.metrics` and :class:`~ignite.handlers`. Argument `output_transform` is a function used to transform `engine.state.output` for intended use. Below we'll see different types of `engine.state.output` and how to transform them.

In the code below, `engine.state.output` will be a list of loss, y_pred, y for the processed batch. If we want to attach :class:`~ignite.metrics.Accuracy` to the engine, `output_transform` will be needed to get y_pred and y from
`engine.state.output`. Let's see how that is done:

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss.item(), y_pred, y

    trainer = Engine(update)

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def print_loss(engine):
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output[0]
        print ('Epoch {epoch}: train_loss = {loss}'.format(epoch=epoch, loss=loss))

    accuracy = Accuracy(output_transform=lambda x: [x[1], x[2]])
    accuracy.attach(trainer, 'acc')
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=10)

Similar to above, but this time the output of the `process_function` is a dictionary of loss, y_pred, y for the processed
batch, this is how the user can use `output_transform` to get y_pred and y from `engine.state.output`. See below:

.. code-block:: python

    def update(engine, batch):
        x, y = batch
        y_pred = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return {'loss': loss.item(),
                'y_pred': y_pred,
                'y': y}

    trainer = Engine(update)

    @trainer.on(Events.EPOCH_COMPLETED)
    def print_loss(engine):
        epoch = engine.state.epoch
        loss = engine.state.output['loss']
        print ('Epoch {epoch}: train_loss = {loss}'.format(epoch=epoch, loss=loss))

    accuracy = Accuracy(output_transform=lambda x: [x['y_pred'], x['y']])
    accuracy.attach(trainer, 'acc')
    trainer.run(data, max_epochs=10)

.. Note ::

   A good practice is to use :class:`~ignite.engine.State` also as a storage of user data created in update or handler functions.
   For example, we would like to save `new_attribute` in the `state`:

   .. code-block:: python

      def user_handler_function(engine):
          engine.state.new_attribute = 12345
