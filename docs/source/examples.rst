Examples
========

There are several examples ported from `pytorch/examples <https://github.com/pytorch/examples>`_ using `ignite`
to display how it helps to write compact and full-featured training loops in a few lines of code:

- `Mnist <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/mnist>`_
- `DCGAN <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/gan>`_
- `Reinforcement Learning <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/reinforcement_learning>`_
- `Fast Neural Style <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/tree/master/examples/fast_neural_style>`_

Notebooks:

- `Text Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/examples/notebooks/TextCNN.ipynb>`_
- `Variational Auto Encoders <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/examples/notebooks/VAE.ipynb>`_
