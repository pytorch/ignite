PyTorch-Ignite governance
=========================

The purpose of this document is to formalize the governance process used by the PyTorch-Ignite project,
to clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact. This document establishes
a decision-making structure that takes into account feedback from all members of the community and strives to find
consensus, while avoiding any deadlocks.

This is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community,
contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process.
This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.

Roles And Responsibilities
--------------------------

Contributors
````````````

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor,
and contributions can take many forms as detailed in the `contributors guide <https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Core developers
```````````````

Core developers are community members who have shown their continued implication in the project
through ongoing engagement with the community and contributions. They have shown they can be trusted to
maintain PyTorch-Ignite with care. Being a core developer allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project
related activities by giving them direct access to the projectâ€™s repository and is represented as being an organization
member on the PyTorch-Ignite GitHub organization.

Core developers are expected to review code contributions, can merge approved pull requests, can cast votes for and
against merging a pull-request, and can be involved in deciding major changes to the API.

New core developers can be nominated by any existing core developers.

Core developers that have not contributed to the project (commits or GitHub comments) in the past 2 months will be asked
if they want to become emeritus core developers and recant their commit rights until they become active again.
