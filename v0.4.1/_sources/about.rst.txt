About us
========

History
-------

This project was started by Alykhan Tejani `@alykhantejani <https://github.com/alykhantejani>`_,
Francisco Massa `@fmassa <https://github.com/fmassa>`_ and Joost van Amersfoort `@y0ast <https://github.com/y0ast>`_
in the end of 2017 and was highly inspired by `torchnet <https://github.com/pytorch/tnt>`_.

In 2018 project core teams has grown and the first public release was published in June 2018.
Since then, several releases have appeared following a ~5 month cycle, and a thriving international community has
been leading the development.

Governance
----------
This project is purely open-source community effort. Project's affiliation to `PyTorch group <https://github.com/pytorch>`_
is due to historical reasons and it has the same implication to the project's governance as for other community projects from
`PyTorch Ecosystem <https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/>`_.

The decision making process and governance structure of the project is described in the `governance document <governance.html>`_.
