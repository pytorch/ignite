class Events(EventEnum):
    """Events that are fired by the :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine` during execution. Built-in events:

    - STARTED : triggered when engine's run is started
    - EPOCH_STARTED : triggered when the epoch is started
    - GET_BATCH_STARTED : triggered before next batch is fetched
    - GET_BATCH_COMPLETED : triggered after the batch is fetched
    - ITERATION_STARTED : triggered when an iteration is started
    - ITERATION_COMPLETED : triggered when the iteration is ended

    - DATALOADER_STOP_ITERATION : engine's specific event triggered when dataloader has no more data to provide

    - EXCEPTION_RAISED : triggered when an exception is encountered
    - TERMINATE_SINGLE_EPOCH : triggered when the run is about to end the current epoch,
      after receiving a :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.terminate_epoch()` or
      :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.terminate()` call.

    - TERMINATE : triggered when the run is about to end completely,
      after receiving :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.terminate()` call.

    - EPOCH_COMPLETED : triggered when the epoch is ended. Note that this is triggered even
      when :meth:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine.terminate_epoch()` is called.
    - COMPLETED : triggered when engine's run is completed

    The table below illustrates which events are triggered when various termination methods are called.

    Since v0.3.0, Events become more flexible and allow to pass an event filter to the Engine:

    .. code-block:: python

        engine = Engine()

        # a) custom event filter
        def custom_event_filter(engine, event):
            if event in [1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100]:
                return True
            return False

        @engine.on(Events.ITERATION_STARTED(event_filter=custom_event_filter))
        def call_on_special_event(engine):
            # do something on 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 iterations

        # b) "every" event filter
        @engine.on(Events.ITERATION_STARTED(every=10))
        def call_every(engine):
            # do something every 10th iteration

        # c) "once" event filter
        @engine.on(Events.ITERATION_STARTED(once=50))
        def call_once(engine):
            # do something on 50th iteration

    Event filter function `event_filter` accepts as input `engine` and `event` and should return True/False.
    Argument `event` is the value of iteration or epoch, depending on which type of Events the function is passed.

    Since v0.4.0, user can also combine events with `|`-operator:

    .. code-block:: python

        events = Events.STARTED | Events.COMPLETED | Events.ITERATION_STARTED(every=3)
        engine = ...

        @engine.on(events)
        def call_on_events(engine):
            # do something

    Since v0.4.0, custom events defined by user should inherit from :class:`~ignite.base.events.EventEnum` :

    .. code-block:: python

        class CustomEvents(EventEnum):
            FOO_EVENT = "foo_event"
            BAR_EVENT = "bar_event"
    """
