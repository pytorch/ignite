class InceptionScore(_BaseInceptionMetric):
    r"""Calculates Inception Score.

    .. math::
       \text{IS(G)} = \exp(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_{KL} (p(y|x^{(i)} \parallel \hat{p}(y))))

    where :math:`p(y|x)` is the conditional probability of image being the given object and
    :math:`p(y)` is the marginal probability that the given image is real, `G` refers to the
    generated image and :math:`D_{KL}` refers to KL Divergence of the above mentioned probabilities.

    Args:
        num_features: number of features predicted by the model or number of classes of the model. Default
            value is 1000.
        feature_extractor: a torch Module for predicting the probabilities from the input data.
            It returns a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_features).
            If neither ``num_features`` nor ``feature_extractor`` are defined, by default we use an ImageNet
            pretrained Inception Model. If only ``num_features`` is defined but ``feature_extractor`` is not
            defined, ``feature_extractor`` is assigned Identity Function.
            Please note that the class object will be implicitly converted to device mentioned in the
            ``device`` argument.
        output_transform: a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`'s ``process_function``'s output into the
            form expected by the metric. This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.
            By default, metrics require the output as ``y_pred``.
        device: specifies which device updates are accumulated on. Setting the
            metric's device to be the same as your ``update`` arguments ensures the ``update`` method is
            non-blocking. By default, CPU.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            from ignite.metric.gan import InceptionScore
            import torch

            images = torch.rand(10, 3, 299, 299)

            m = InceptionScore()
            m.update(images)
            print(m.compute())
