class Loss(Metric):
    """
    Calculates the average loss according to the passed loss_fn.

    Args:
        loss_fn (callable): a callable taking a prediction tensor, a target
            tensor, optionally other arguments, and returns the average loss
            over all observations in the batch.
        output_transform (callable): a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`~ignite.engine.engine.Engine`'s ``process_function``'s output into the
            form expected by the metric.
            This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.
            The output is expected to be a tuple `(prediction, target)` or
            (prediction, target, kwargs) where kwargs is a dictionary of extra
            keywords arguments. If extra keywords arguments are provided they are passed to `loss_fn`.
        batch_size (callable): a callable taking a target tensor that returns the
            first dimension size (usually the batch size).
        device (str or torch.device): specifies which device updates are accumulated on. Setting the
            metric's device to be the same as your ``update`` arguments ensures the ``update`` method is
            non-blocking. By default, CPU.
