    Calculates the average loss according to the passed loss_fn.

    Args:
        loss_fn (callable): a callable taking a prediction tensor, a target
            tensor, optionally other arguments, and returns the average loss
            over all observations in the batch.
        output_transform (callable): a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`ignite.engine.Engine`'s `process_function`'s output into the
            form expected by the metric.
            This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.
            The output is is expected to be a tuple (prediction, target) or
            (prediction, target, kwargs) where kwargs is a dictionary of extra
            keywords arguments.
