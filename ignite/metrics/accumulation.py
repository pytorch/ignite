class VariableAccumulation(Metric):
    """Single variable accumulator helper to compute (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic) average of a single variable.

    - `update` must receive output of the form `x`.
    - `x` can be a number or `torch.Tensor`.

    Note:

        The class stores input into two public variables: `accumulator` and `num_examples`.
        Number of samples is updated following the rule:

        - `+1` if input is a number
        - `+1` if input is a 1D `torch.Tensor`
        - `+batch_size` if input is a ND `torch.Tensor`. Batch size is the first dimension (`shape[0]`).

    Args:
        op (callable): a callable to update accumulator. Method's signature is `(accumulator, output)`.
            For example, to compute arithmetic mean value, `op = lambda a, x: a + x`.
        output_transform (callable, optional): a callable that is used to transform the
            :class:`~ignite.engine.Engine`'s `process_function`'s output into the
            form expected by the metric. This can be useful if, for example, you have a multi-output model and
            you want to compute the metric with respect to one of the outputs.
        device (str of torch.device, optional): device specification in case of distributed computation usage.
            In most of the cases, it can be defined as "cuda:local_rank" or "cuda"
            if already set `torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)`. By default, if a distributed process group is
            initialized and available, device is set to `cuda`.
